# BadMetronome
> A metronome that makes mistakes

### Background
I remember hearing [Victor Wooten](https://www.victorwooten.com/) say several times that he wished for a metronome that would make mistakes like a real drummer might. I think the idea was that you'd be able to really develop your listening, and that if you could play with a bad drummer you could play with any drummer. This project attempts to harness that idea and bring to life.
